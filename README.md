Visualizing images as histograms

This script uses matplotlib and seaborn (which is awesome, by the way, 
check it out: http://www.stanford.edu/~mwaskom/software/seaborn/) to display images
as histograms for a neat effect. One issue I ran into is that seaborn's 'jointplot' 
doesn't allow you to set the granularity, or 'bucket sizes,' of its hex plot, 
although matplotlib.pyplot.hex does.

My github profile pic is an example of what you can generate with this script.
Enjoy!
